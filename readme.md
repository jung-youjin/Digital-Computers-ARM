### Lab0 - BASIC Input / Output  
- Tried different memory addressing modes to test input and output  

### Lab1 - Flash LED  
- Used on-board RAM instead of Flash memory to flash an LED with 1Hz frequency  

### Lab2 - Subroutines and Parameters Passing  
- Made and called small subroutines to execute the main program  
- Passed parameters and status to the subroutines
- Implemented Morse code transmitting system using LED with time delay configurations  

### Lab3 - Input / Output Interfacing  
- Controlled the LEDs and switch for input and output interfacing
- Used simple counter subroutines for time increment
- Implemented a reflex meter that catches the human reaction time to the LED light and the switch  

### Lab4 - Interrupt Handling  
- Wrote an interrupt service routine(ISR) which is triggered when the user presses the SW1 button
- Implemented a random number generator to configure a falling edge SW1 interrupt
